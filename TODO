    ☐ Make uniform widths for elements after writing all of them down
Archive:
  ✔ Make type Element msg boxes that are placeholders for the lanthanide and actinide series with xops and ypos. @done(19-03-10 19:06) @project(Todo)
  ✔ make the molecule type able to handle maybe cases @done(18-10-23 17:56) @project(Todo)
  ✔ find out why importing atomList doesn't allow you to access atoms like barium and sulfur. @done(18-10-23 10:01) It's because i didn't name them! I just have a list of type aliases. Damn @project(Todo)
  ✔ make a function that takes in an atomic weight and outputs a string with correct amount of decimal places (16.000 -> 16 when you do it regularly) @done(18-10-23 09:59) @project(Todo)
  ✔ more sections for atom (halogen, post transition metals, etc. colours can be the same) @done(18-10-18 00:20) @project(Todo)
  ✔ Figure out what the heck is happening to the DataParser. Probably has something to do with union type @done(18-10-17 10:22) @project(Todo)
    ✔ make atom boxes have 10px margins (Element.spacing 10) in them (when I do the periodic table ofc) @done(18-10-15 22:34) @project(Todo)
    ✔ smaller atombox @done(18-10-15 19:45) @project(Todo)
