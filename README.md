# Joshua's Compsci IA

This repository holds my code for my Compsci IA, which is a periodic table web app. See it in action [here](https://joshuanianji.github.io)!

## Quick Info

Written in [Elm](https://www.elm-lang.org), a functional programming language that compiles to Javascript. I have the compiled code on my [github pages repository](https://joshuanianji.github.io) (which currently only contains like 2 files lol)

As of today, this only has a slightly interactive periodic table and a molar mass calculator.

Please dont access the site on a mobile device or a small tablet oh my goodness it looks horrible.

Ok so supposedly there's a thing called "Github Wiki" and I think that's really cool so I'm going to put all my other stuff there and leave my readme like this.
