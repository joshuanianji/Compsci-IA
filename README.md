# Joshua's Compsci IA

This repository holds my code for my Compsci IA, which is a periodic table web app. See it in action [here](https://joshuaji.com/projects/ptable)!

## Quick Info

* Written in [Elm](https://www.elm-lang.org), a functional programming language that compiles to Javascript. I have the compiled code on this [github repo](https://github.com/joshuanianji/Compsci-IA) (inside the projects folder).

* As of today, this only has a slightly interactive periodic table and a molar mass calculator.

* Periodic table elements retrieved via Bowserinator's [Periodic Table JSON](https://github.com/Bowserinator/Periodic-Table-JSON).

* Not working on mobile devices yet.

## Run Locally

npm i 
npm run dev
