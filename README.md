# Joshua's Compsci IA

Before I made my README a changelog but that's kinda weird lol. I don't really know what to put here so uh,,,,,,yeah. Do I put a user documentation here? Like is it not user friendly enough? Just remember to put capitals in the molar mass calculator lol.

Oh I guess I should do something like "go to my [website](joshuanianji.github.io)" to access the actual thingy. My website literally has nothing else on it except this project rip so don't expect much.

Anyways this place just holds my Elm code because the Elm compiles to javascript, so I just put the HTML file with the javascript inside the [joshuanianji.github.io](https://github.com/joshuanianji/joshuanianji.github.io) repository. That repo currently has 2 files lol.
